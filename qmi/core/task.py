"""Background tasks for QMI.

This module provides support for tasks which run asynchronously in the background.

Defining tasks
##############

To define a new background task, create a subclass of `QMI_Task`.
The new class must define a `run()` method, containing the main code of the task.
It may also be helpful to redefine the `__init__()` method in order
to accept arguments and initialize the task.

A task may define two types of special variables:

- **settings**: data that affects the behaviour of the task.
  Settings can be modified by other tasks or scripts while the task
  is still running.

- **status**: data that represents the current activity of the task.
  The task can change its own status while it runs, but other tasks or
  scripts can not change this task's status.

Declare two custom named tuple types to contain the settings resp. the status
of your task. Instances of these named tuples will be used to store the
current settings in ``self.settings`` and the current status in ``self.status``.

Example of a custom task definition::

    MySettings = namedtuple("MySettings", "param other_param")
    MyStatus = namedtuple("MyStatus", "field other_field")

    class MyTask(QMI_Task):
        def __init__(self, task_runner, name, my_arg, my_other_arg):
            super().__init__(task_runner, name)
            self.settings = MySettings(...)
            self.status = MyStatus(...)
            ...
        def run(self):
            while not self.stop_requested():
                self.update_settings()
                ...

Running tasks
#############

Tasks are created via the QMI context.
The context then returns a `proxy` for the new task instance.
A newly created task must be explicitly started by calling the `start()`
method through the proxy.

A task stops when its `run()` method returns.
Alternatively, the `stop()` method may be called through the proxy to request
that the task stops itself as soon as possible.
Even in this case, the task will still continue to run until its `run()` method
honours the stop request by returning.

To clean up a stopped task, call the `join()` method through the proxy.
The `join()` method will wait until the task has stopped, if necessary,
then clean up the background thread.

Example of starting and stopping a task::

    proxy = qmi.make_task("my_task", MyTask, "arg1", "arg2")
    proxy.start()
    ...
    new_settings = MySettings(...)
    proxy.set_settings(new_settings)
    ...
    status = proxy.get_status()
    print("Status:", status)
    ...
    proxy.stop()
    proxy.join()

Custom Task Runner
##################

It's possible to define a custom task runner and have qmi use _it_ instead of a
default `QMI_TaskRunner` instance. This will allow custom RPC methods and state
to be added to the runner, which can be useful in some cases.

Example of a custom task runner::

    class MyTaskRunner(QMI_TaskRunner):
        @rpc_method
        def set_param(self, param):
            settings = self.get_pending_settings()
            settings._replace(param=param)
            self.set_settings(settings)

    proxy = qmi.make_task("my_task", MyTask, "arg1", "arg2", task_runner=MyTaskRunner)
    proxy.start()
    ...
    proxy.set_param(...)
    ...
    proxy.stop()
    proxy.join()
