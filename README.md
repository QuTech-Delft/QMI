# Quantum Measurement Infrastructure

QMI is a Python 3 framework for controlling laboratory equipment. It is suitable for anything ranging from one-off
scientific experiments to robust operational setups.

QMI is developed by [QuTech](https://qutech.nl) to support advanced physics experiments involving quantum bits.
However, other than its name and original purpose, there is nothing specifically *quantum* about QMI â€” it is potentially
useful in any environment where monitoring and control of measurement equipment is needed.

## Installation

Currently, no PIP installation is possible. Please clone and setup with `python setup.py install`.
