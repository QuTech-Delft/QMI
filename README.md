# Quantum Measurement Infrastructure

QMI is a Python 3 framework for controlling laboratory equipment. It is suitable for anything ranging from one-off
scientific experiments to robust operational setups.

QMI is developed by [QuTech](https://qutech.nl) to support advanced physics experiments involving quantum bits.
However, other than its name and original purpose, there is nothing specifically *quantum* about QMI â€” it is potentially
useful in any environment where monitoring and control of measurement equipment is needed.

Technische Universiteit Delft hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program QMI (Quantum Measurement Infrastructure), a lab instrument remote procedure call control framework written by the QuTech.

## Installation

You can install QMI using pip. 

```sh
pip install qmi
```

```sh
pip list
```
and checking that in the output you see line
```sh
qmi                     V.R.P
```
where V.R.P. are the Version-Revision-Patch numbers. These should match the numbers of the latest documentation link below.

See [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#configuration) for where to put `pip.conf` for specific operating
systems and virtual environments.
